<h1>Introducing OpenMEE</h1>

<p>OpenMEE is open-source software for performing meta-analysis suited to the need of ecologist and evolutionary biologists. This program is made possible by the National Science Foundation (NSF), award numbers: DBI-1262402 (J. Gurevitch), DBI-1262442 (B. Wallace), DBI-1262545 (M.J. Lajeunesse).</p>

<h3>Installing OpenMEE</h3>
<ol>
    <li>To install OpenMEE, download the program from:<br/> <a href="http://www.cebm.brown.edu/open_mee/download">http://www.cebm.brown.edu/open_mee/download</a></li>
    <li>Save the zip file somewhere convenient and extract it (just double-clicking should do on most systems).</li>
</ol>

<h3> Starting OpenMEE </h3>

<p>Launch the program by clicking on LaunchOpenMEE.exe in the case of Windows or, on Mac, the OpenMEE app. This will open the main spreadsheet. </p>

<h3> The OpenMEE Spreadsheet </h3>

<figure>
  <img src="img/opening_screen.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 1. The main spreadsheet interface</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You will enter and interact with your data via this spreadsheet. From this spreadsheet you can enter your data in the following ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Entering the data manually by typing it in to the spreadsheet.</li>
<li>Opening a previously saved dataset (.ome) file</li>
<li>Importing a CSV file (with or without column headers)</li>
</ol>

<p>The latter two are accessible via the <i>File</i> menu.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="img/file_menu.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 2. The <i>File</i> menu </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The OpenMEE spreadsheet is very flexible. It has an unlimited number of rows and columns. The spreadsheets starts off with a fixed (large) size. As your data approaches the limits, the spreadsheet automatically resizes itself to accomodate more data. You also don't have to worry about formatting your data beforehand. Simply enter your data in whatever format you have it. For example, After typing in some two-by-two contingency table data we see the screen below.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="img/screen_after_entering_data.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 3. Main screen after typing in data </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Along the top of the spreadsheet we see columns labelled 'A', 'B', 'C', etc., along with '(cat)'. When you enter data into a new column, OpenMEE assumes by default that said column is a new categorical variable and assigns it a default name. When you are done typing in new data, you have to tell OpenMEE what kind of data type each column contains (e.g., continuous). You also must mark one column as the study labels column.</p>

<p>In addition to telling OpenMEE the types of each column, you may also assign your own custom labels (names) to each column. All this is done by right-clicking on column headers and choosing the desired option as shown below:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="img/context_menu.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 4. <i>Context</i> menu, accessible by right-click.</figcaption>
</figure>

You can rename columns by clicking on the 'rename variable' option of the <i>context</i> menu. 

<figure>
  <img src="img/after_renaming_columns.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 5. After renaming columns.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We now have to tell OpenMEE what type of data these columns contain. Again, this is done by right-clicking and selecting a target format from the <i>Change format</i> submenu as shown in Figure 4. Since this is two-by-two data, the four numerical columns are 'counts' while 'Country' and 'Year' are categorical variables, and 'study_name' is the variable we will mark as containing study labels (by selecting 'Mark as label column' from the <i>context</i> menu). Finally out of pedagogical necesssity, let's add a continuous column after country called 'Avg. Rainfall (cm)'. After assigning all these formats, we see </p>

<figure>
  <img src="img/after_setting_types.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 6. After Setting Variable Formats</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Note that for each variable format has its own color scheme as reminder when you're working with the spreadsheet. If you can't stand the default color scheme you can change it by clicking on the <i>Table</i> menu and then <i>Table Preferences</i>:

<figure>
  <img src="img/preferences_dlg.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 7. Preferences</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here, you can change the color schemes of the variables as well as the font used on the spreadsheet as well as the number of digits displayed for continuous variables. </p>

<h3>Calculating an Effect Size </h3>

<p>Before we can run an analysis, we need effect sizes and associated variances. These can be input in one of two ways:

<ol>
    <li>Entering an effect size and variance manually (i.e., not entering 'raw data')</li>
    <li>Calculating an Effect Size from the raw data</li>
</ol>

We will consider each option in turn </p>

<h4>Entering an effect size and variance manually </h4>

<p>To do this, simply create two new continuous variables using the method described above. Let's call them "my effect size" and "my variance". Now we need to tell OpenMEE that these are effects. Right-click on the header for "my effect size" and choose <i>Change format</i> &#8594; <i>Trans. Effect</i>. Likewise, choose 'Change Format &#8594; Trans. Var' for "my variance" as shown in the Figure below.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="img/change_continuous_var_to_trans_effect.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 8. Changing continuous variance to transformed-scale effect</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We will then see the screen below</p>


<figure>
  <img src="img/set_effect_size_format.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 9. After setting effect size format.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Here we need to discuss the issue of 'transformed' scale vs. 'raw' scale. To perform a meta-analysis, we need an effect size and a measure of dispersion for each study. For example, if our metric is the odds ratio, we need the effect size on the transformed (log) scale because confidence intervals for odds ratios are generally not symmetric in the raw (untransformed) scale. Fortunately, OpenMEE can transform an effect size and confidence interval (or effect size and variance) from one scale another.</p>

<h4>Calculating an effect size from raw data</h4>

<figure>
  <img src="img/calc_effect_size/1_calculate_effect_size_wizard.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 10. Calculate Effect Size Wizard</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To calculate an effect size from raw data, click the 'Calculate Effect Size' button on the toolbar, or select 'Calculate Effect Size' from the <i>analysis</i> menu. This will show the wizard in Figure 10. First, you have to select a data type and a metric.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="img/calc_effect_size/2_data_location_selection.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 11. Data location selection</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Next tell OpenMEE the locations of the necessary variables as show in Figure 11. You will be given the option to link the raw data columns to the resulting effect size columns (selected by default). This makes it so that when you change a value in the raw data, the effect column will update automagically.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="img/calc_effect_size/3_effects_calculated.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 12. Calculated effect size.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In Figure 12, we see the calculated effect size and variance in the 'transformed' (natural log) scale. Also, note that on the bottom of the window we see a red bar. This provides a visual cue that the four raw data columns cont. #events, #cont #noevents, etc are 'linked' to the effect and variance columns.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="img/calc_effect_size/6_transformed_effect_result.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 13. Transformed Effect Size Result </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In Figure 13, we see the result of transforming the effect size. Three new columns have been added containing the 'raw scale' effect size and upper and lower confidence bounds given the current confidence level shown in the toolbar. Changing the confidence level in the toolbar will cause the confidence interval to be recalculated.
</p>

<h2> Running Analyses </h2>

<p> All analyses are performed similiarly. You can choose to perform an analysis by clicking its icon in the toolbar or by selecting it from the <i>Analysis</i> menu. More exotic analyses (such as 'bootstrapped' meta regression, meta-regression-based conditional means and boostrapped meta regression-based conditional means) are only accessible from the menu bar. </p>

<p>Here we describe the pages you see on the wizards for each analysis (this is similar for all analyses).</p>

<h3>Standard Meta Analysis</h3>

<p>Here we refer to analyses that look to estimate a 'grand mean', i.e., with no covariates. The pages you will see are as follows.</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Data Type and Metric</b>. <br/><br/>
    <img src="img/data_type_effect_size.png" width="25%" height="25%"/> <br/><br/>
    Here you will need to select the data type and effect size. Note that for the latter, you can elect a 'generic effect' if you need.
  </li><br/>

  <li><b>Data Location</b>
    <img src="img/choose_outcome.png" width="25%" height="25%"/> <br/><br/>
    Now you will need to select your effect size and variance columns. Here, for example, we have selected ln OR and the variance thereof. In general, the effect size and variance combo boxes will allow you to select any columns that you have designated as effect sizes and variances, respectively.
  </li>

  <li>Refine studies/categories/exclude studies with specific missing data </li>
  <li>Analysis Method and Parameters</li>
  <li>Summary Page</li>
</ol>

<h3>Cumulative Meta Analysis </h3>
<h3>Leave One Out Meta Analysis </h3>
<p> The options for Cumulative Meta Analaysis and Leave-One-Out meta analysis are the same as for Standard Meta Analysis </p>

<h3> Subgroup Meta Analysis </h3>
<p> The options for subgroup meta analysis are the same as for standard meta analysis except for a categorical variable must be selected (SHOW PICTURE). For example, if the selected variable is Gender, the subgroup analyses will be run on the Male and Female subgroups.

<h3> Meta Regression </h3>
<p> The wizard for subgroup meta analysis are the same as for standard meta analysis aside two additional pages.
<ol>
  <li>
  On the 'Select covariates for regression page', you select the covariates for regression(big surprise). On this same page you choose whether you want to use a random or fixed effects model and the confidence level to use in the analysis.
  </li>
  <li> Reference Values - If you select categorical covariate(s) you can opt to choose which value will serve as the reference value (for the intercept)
  </li>
</ol>

<h3> Boostrapped Meta Analysis </h3>
<p> The options for boostrapped meta-analysis are the same as those for standard meta analysis aside from the fact that on the boostrap parameters page you can choose choose various parameters for the bootstrap including the # of bootstrap replictes to perform. When running bootstrap operations in OpenMEE, the program tries to generate results using the selected # of bootstrap replicates. So, if one particular replicate attempt fails, another is tried, and so on until 5 times the selecte # of bootstrap replicates have been attempted, at which point an error message is returned </p>
