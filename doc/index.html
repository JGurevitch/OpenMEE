<h1>Introducing OpenMEE</h1>

<p>OpenMEE is open-source software for performing meta-analysis suited to the need of ecologist and evolutionary biologists.</p>


<h3>Installing OpenMEE</h3>
<ol>
    <li>To install OpenMEE, download the program from:</br> http://www.cebm.brown.edu/open_mee/download </li>
    <li>Save the zip file somewhere convenient and extract it.</li>
</ol>

<h3> Starting OpenMEE </h3>

<p>Launch the program by clicking on LaunchOpenMEE.exe in the case of Windows or the OpenMEE app in the case of Macintosh. This opens the main spreadsheet as shown below. </p>


<figure>
  <img src="img/opening_screen.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 1. The main spreadsheet screen</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
You enter and interact with your data on this spreadsheet. 


<p>  --------------- NEW PAGE?  --------------- </p>

<h3> The OpenMEE Spreadsheet </h3>

<figure>
  <img src="img/opening_screen.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 1. The main spreadsheet screen</figcaption>
</figure>

From this spreadsheet you can enter your data by:

<ol>
<li>Entering the data manually by typing it in to the spreadsheet.</li>
<li>Opening a previously saved dataset (.ome) file from the file menu</li>
<li>Importing a CSV file (with or without column headers)</li>
</ol>

<figure>
  <img src="img/file_menu.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 2. The file menu </figcaption>
</figure>



<p>The OpenMEE spreadsheet is very flexible. It has an unlimited number of rows and columns. The spreadsheets starts off with a fixed (large) size. As your data approaches the limits, the spreadsheet automatically resizes itself to accomodate more data. You also don't have to worry about formatting your data beforehand. You simply enter your data in whatever format you have it. For example, After typing in some two-by-two contingency table data we see the screen below. </p>

<figure>
  <img src="img/screen_after_entering_data.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 3. Main screen after typing in data </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Along the top of the spreadsheet we see the columns are labelled 'A', 'B', 'C' etc. along with '(cat)'. When you enter data into a new column, by default OpenMEE assumes that column is a new categorical variable and assigns it the default name. When you are done typing in new information, you have to tell OpenMEE what kind of data each column contains. You also must mark one column as the study labels column. In addition to telling OpenMEE the types of each column, you also assign your own custom labels to each column. All this is done by right-clicking on column headers and choosing the desired option as shown below:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="img/context_menu.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 4. Context Menu</figcaption>
</figure>

Let's rename the columns now. We do this by clicking on the 'rename variable' option of the context menu. After renaming the columns, the screen looks like this:

<figure>
  <img src="img/after_renaming_columns.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 5. After Renaming Columns</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We now have to tell OpenMEE what type of data these columns contain. Again, this is done by right clicking and selecting a target format from the 'Change format' submenu as shown in Figure 4: Context Menu. Since this is two-by-two data, the 4 numerical columns are 'counts' while 'Country' and 'Year' are categorical variables, and 'study_name' is clearly the variable we will mark as the study labels by selecting 'Mark as label column' in the context menu. Finally out of pedagogical necesssity, let's add a continuous column after country called 'Avg. Rainfall (cm)'. After assigning all these formats, we obtain the following: </p>

<figure>
  <img src="img/after_setting_types.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 6. After Setting Variable Formats</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Note that for each variable format has its own color scheme as reminder when you're working with the spreadsheet. If you can't stand the default color scheme you can change it by clicking on the 'Table Menu' and then 'Table Preferences':

<figure>
  <img src="img/preferences_dlg.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 7. Preferences</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here, you can change the color schemes of the variables as well as the font used on the spreadsheet as well as the number of digits displayed for continuous variables. </p>

<h3> Calculating an Effect Size </h3>

Before we can run an analysis, we need an effect size and variance. We can get this in one of two ways:

<ol>
    <li>Entering an effect size and variance manually (e.g. when raw data is not available)</li>
    <li>Calculating an Effect Size from the raw data
</ol>

<p> We will examine each option in turn </p>

<h4> Entering an effect size and variance manually </h4>
<p> To do this, we simply create two new continuous variables using the method we described earlier. Let's call them "my effect size" and "my variance". In order to use these variables as effects in a meta analysis we need to tell OpenMEE that these are effects. Right click on the header for "my effect size" and choose 'Change format -----> Trans. Effect'. Likewise, choose 'Change Format ----> Trans. Var' for "my variance" as shown in the Figure below.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="img/change_continuous_var_to_trans_effect.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 8. Change Continuous Variance to Transformed-scale Effect</figcaption>
</figure>

<p> Once we have finished changing the format of these two variables, we have the screen shown below </p>


<figure>
  <img src="img/set_effect_size_format.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 9. After Setting Effect Size Format </figcaption>
</figure>


<p> We show now take an aside to discuss transformed-scale vs. raw-scale. In order to perform a meta-analysis, we need an effect size and a single measure of dispersion for each study. For example, if our metric is "Odds ratio" we need the effect size on the transformed (log) scale since confidence intervals for odds ratios are generally not symmetric in the raw (untransformed) scale. It just so happens, however, that OpenMEE is capable of transforming an effect size and confidence interval or effect size and variance from one scale to the other. We will see how to do this soon.</p>

<h4> Calculating an Effect Size from the raw data </h4>

<figure>
  <img src="img/calc_effect_size/1_calculate_effect_size_wizard.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 10. Calculate Effect Size Wizard</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In order to calculate an effect size from raw data, click the 'Calculate Effect Size' button on the toolbar or select 'Calculate Effect Size' from the analysis menu. This will show the wizard in Figure 10. First, you have to select a data type and a metric.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="img/calc_effect_size/2_data_location_selection.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 11. Data location selection</figcaption>
</figure>


<p> Then, you tell OpenMEE the locations of the necessary variables as show in Figure 11. You will be given the option to link the raw data columns to the resulting effect size columns (selected by default). This makes it so that when you change a value in the raw data, the effect column result will update automatically.


<figure>
  <img src="img/calc_effect_size/3_effects_calculated.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 12. Effect Size calculated </figcaption>
</figure>

<p> In Figure 12, we see the calculated effect size and variance in the 'transformed scale' (lnOR and Var(ln OR)). Also, note on the bottom of the window, we see a red bar. This provides a visual cue that the four raw data columns cont. #events, #cont #noevents, etc are linked to the effect and variance columns.

<figure>
  <img src="img/calc_effect_size/6_transformed_effect_result.png">
  <figcaption>Figure 13. Transformed Effect Size Result </figcaption>
</figure>

<p> Finally in Figure 13, we see the result of transforming the effect size. Three new columns have been added containing the 'raw scale' effect size and upper and lower confidence bounds given the current confidence level shown in the toolbar. Changing the confidence level in the toolbar will cause the confidence interval to recalculate.
</p>

<!-- This would be a good breakpoint -->

<h2> Running Analyses </h2>
<p> All analyses are performed similiarly. You can choose to perform an analysis by clicking its icon in the toolbar or by selecting it from the Analysis menu. More exotic analyses such as bootstrapped meta regression, meta-regression-based conditional means and, boostrapped meta regression-based conditional means are only accessible from the menu bar. </p>
<p> Since all the analyses are similiar, I will describe the pages you see on the wizards for each analysis.</p>

<h3> Standard Meta Analysis </h3>
<ol>
  <li>Data Type & Metric</li>
  <li>Data Location</li>
  <li>Refine studies/categories/exclude studies with specific missing data </li>
  <li>Analysis Method and Parameters</li>
  <li>Summary Page</li>
</ol>

<h3> Cumulative Meta Analysis </h3>
<h3> Leave One Out Meta Analysis </h3>
<p> The options for Cumulative Meta Analaysis and Leave-One-Out meta analysis are the same as for Standard Meta Analysis </p>

<h3> Subgroup Meta Analysis </h3>
<p> The options for subgroup meta analysis are the same as for standard meta analysis except for a categorical variable must be selected (SHOW PICTURE). For example, if the selected variable is Gender, the subgroup analyses will be run on the Male and Female subgroups.

<h3> Meta Regression </h3>
<p> The wizard for subgroup meta analysis are the same as for standard meta analysis aside two additional pages.
<ol>
  <li>
  On the 'Select covariates for regression page', you select the covariates for regression(big surprise). On this same page you choose whether you want to use a random or fixed effects model and the confidence level to use in the analysis.
  </li>
  <li> Reference Values - If you select categorical covariate(s) you can opt to choose which value will serve as the reference value (for the intercept)
  </li>
</ol>

<h3> Boostrapped Meta Analysis </h3>
<p> The options for boostrapped meta-analysis are the same as those for standard meta analysis aside from the fact that on the boostrap parameters page you can choose choose various parameters for the bootstrap including the # of bootstrap replictes to perform. When running bootstrap operations in OpenMEE, the program tries to generate results using the selected # of bootstrap replicates. So, if one particular replicate attempt fails, another is tried, and so on until 5 times the selecte # of bootstrap replicates have been attempted, at which point an error message is returned </p>
